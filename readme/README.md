## Usage
To use this study guide, youn can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome Devtools by pressing command+option+I(MacOS) or CTRL+Shift+I(Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
